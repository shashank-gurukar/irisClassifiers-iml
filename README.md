EM Algorithm and K-means-clustering
In the Introduction to Machine Learning (IS6E103) mini project, the Iris dataset was classified using the EM algorithm and K-means clustering. The EM algorithm, an iterative technique for estimating parameters in probabilistic models with latent variables, achieved an accuracy of 0.967. By iteratively computing expected latent variable values and updating parameter estimates, the EM algorithm accurately assigned Iris flowers to their respective species based on attribute measurements.

On the other hand, K-means clustering, an unsupervised algorithm for grouping similar data points, achieved an accuracy of 0.893. Despite a slightly lower accuracy, K-means clustering effectively clustered the Iris dataset by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest centroid.

In summary, the EM algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy (0.967) compared to K-means clustering (0.893) for classifying the Iris dataset. The EM algorithm's utilization of latent variables and iterative parameter estimation contributed to its successful classification. However, both algorithms showcased their strengths in different areas, with the EM algorithm excelling in probabilistic modeling and K-means clustering being effective for data grouping.
